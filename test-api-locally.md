# Setup local Galasa APIs for testing

## Overview

In order to test new developments on the Galasa API servlets you need to be able to run them locally.
The below instructions will help you setup couchDB, etcd and a local API server in order to run tests against the corresponding Galasa APIs.

## External Applications

If you want to test the API server as if it was running as part of an ecosystem you will need to install and run applications external to galasa.

The Galasa API service will still run if none of these applications is installed. It will use the local Galasa settings in the `.galasa` directory.

### 1.1 CouchDB

The current version of CouchDB that is used by Galasa is version 2.3.1 which can be downloaded [here](https://couchdb.apache.org/#download).

Alternatively you can downlaod it from the [archive](http://archive.apache.org/dist/couchdb/binary/)

Once you have installed CouchDB you will need to create a username and password in order to authorise tranactions with the database. Keep this in mind as you will need it to view and access the database.

You should now be able access your local couchDB by going to [http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils](http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils)
Once you have logged in you should be able to go to the verification page and verify the couchDB Installation by clicking the green "Verify Installation" button and getting a success message.

### 1.2 etcd

Install etcd on your machine by following the official instructions [here](https://etcd.io/docs/v3.5/install/)

## 2. Set Environment variables and aliases

As the commands for running the API server or even a test are so big, it would be wise to make aliases for them by placing the text below into your shell's rc file.
Additionally setting the export for the authorization token from above means you will only need to do it once in the rc file.

To see which file you will need to update, check the shell you are using by running `echo $SHELL`.
Use the table below to determine which file in your home direcotry you will need to change:

|$SHELL   |filename|
|---------|--------|
|/bin/zsh |.zshrc  |
|/bin/bash|.bashrc |
|/bin/sh  |.shrc   |
|/bin/ksh |.kshrc  |

Open the file and paste the below in replacing `${HOME}` with the fully qualified path to your home directory, which can be identified using `echo $HOME`.
Please note that the version numbers in these commmands will need to be updated to the next version number of Galasa in order to work with your changes.

```shell
export GALASA_OBR_VERSION=0.31.0
export GALASA_BOOT_JAR_VERSION=0.31.0
alias galasaapi='java -jar ~/.m2/repository/dev/galasa/galasa-boot/${GALASA_BOOT_JAR_VERSION}/galasa-boot-${GALASA_BOOT_JAR_VERSION}.jar --api --localmaven file://${HOME}/.m2/repository/ --remotemaven https://development.galasa.dev/ --obr mvn:dev.galasa/dev.galasa.uber.obr/${GALASA_OBR_VERSION}/obr ;'

alias galasatest='java -jar ~/.m2/repository/dev/galasa/galasa-boot/${GALASA_BOOT_JAR_VERSION}/galasa-boot-${GALASA_BOOT_JAR_VERSION}.jar --api --localmaven file://${HOME}/.m2/repository/ --remotemaven https://development.galasa.dev/  --obr mvn:dev.galasa/dev.galasa.uber.obr/${GALASA_OBR_VERSION}/obr  --obr mvn:dev.galasa.example.banking/dev.galasa.example.banking.obr/0.0.1-SNAPSHOT/obr --test dev.galasa.example.banking.account/dev.galasa.example.banking.account.TestAccount;'

```

You will need to reload the file to take effect using the following command and replacing the `.zshrc` with the appropriate file name depending on your shell.

``` shell
% source ~/.zshrc
```

## 3. Update Properties files

Before you can run a test against the new database you will need to tell Galasa where your database is. To do this insert the below lines into the corresponding files in your .galasa direcotry.

Please note that if you make future runs against a Galasa ecosystem you will need to override these properties.

#### cps.properties

```shell
framework.resultarchive.store=couchdb:http://127.0.0.1:5984
```

When the local API server is started for the first time, you will also need to supply this property into the CPS API in order for Galasa to pick it up.

To do this run the command below using `galasactl`.

```shell
galasactl properties set --namespace framework --name resultarchive.store --value "http://127.0.0.1:5984"
```

#### bootstrap.properties

```shell
framework.config.store=etcd\:http\://127.0.0.1\:2379
framework.extra.bundles=dev.galasa.cps.etcd,dev.galasa.ras.couchdb
```

### 3.1 Update Properties for CouchDB only

If you are only using the couchDB external application you will need to use the lines in this section with your local Galasa API instance.

#### 3.1.1 cps.properties

```shell
framework.resultarchive.store=couchdb:http://127.0.0.1:5984
```

#### 3.1.2 bootstrap.properties

```shell
framework.extra.bundles=dev.galasa.ras.couchdb
```

### 3.2 Update Properties for etcd only

If you are only using the etcd external application you will need to use the lines in this section with your local Galasa API instance.

#### 3.2.1 bootstrap.properties

```shell
framework.config.store=etcd\:http\://127.0.0.1\:2379
framework.extra.bundles=dev.galasa.cps.etcd
```

### 4. Build the framework locally

In order to run the full functionality you will need to have all core framework projects downloaded and built by using the [build-all-locally.sh](../200-automation/building-locally.md) script. If you do not have that script speak to another developer to get it.
You will not be able to continue without a full local build.

### 5. Start the API server

You are now ready to run your test file.

If you are using the etcd/couchDB external applications please start those before using the aliases to avoid start-up errors from galasa.

The `galasatest` alias uses the tests generated by the cli from the full build in order to run a test and populate the database.

Once you have a finished test you should be able to use the `galasaapi` alias to start the API server on [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080) where you can navigate to the appropriate API via a web browser or the `galasactl` CLI.
